            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              City navigated an unbeaten path to the final, racking up a competition-best 31 goals in the process, so it was little surprise that they started on the front foot. Inter had let in only one goal in six knockout games, however, and for so long did an excellent job of marshalling their opponents' galaxy of attacking talent.

                The Gunners have made their move for top target Declan Rice and are now chasing a deal to sign Kai Havertz from rivals Chelsea in an eye-catching start to the summer trading period.<br>
                The Blues are believed to be keen to recoup the money they spent to sign Havertz in 2020, in excess of £70m, and sources have confirmed that Real Madrid have backed away from the negotiating table as things stand.

              Messi's arrival to Miami is a commercial, footballing mountain of an opportunity for America. We have already seen the numbers. Since the news in June, Inter Miami's social media and digital presence has hit ridiculous numbers. Its Instagram account, for example, grew by 750% since the announcement on June 7.<br>
              According to Sportico, Messi's 2½-year deal with Inter Miami is "worth up to $150 million total from his salary, signing bonus, and equity in the team."Messi would be earning somewhere between $50 and $60 million per season.<br>

              Spanish forward Rodrigo Moreno has joined Qatar's Al-Rayyan from Leeds United, the Championship club said on Thursday. The length of the contract and the transfer fee were not disclosed.<br>
              The 32-year-old, who arrived at Elland Road from Spanish side Valencia in 2020, emerged as their top scorer last season with 15 goals but was unable to prevent the club from being relegated from the Premier League to the second-tier Championship.<br>
